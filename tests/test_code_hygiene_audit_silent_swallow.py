"""Regression tests for silent exception swallow fix in code_hygiene_audit.py (INFRA-243 / PR #573).

Bug: SwallowVisitor._extract_evidence (~L166) used a bare
``except Exception: pass``, silently swallowing evidence-extraction failures
(file read / BOM strip / utf-8 decode errors) with zero observability. This was
especially ironic because code_hygiene_audit.py is itself the tool that detects
the SILENT_SWALLOW rule.

Fix: The except clause now binds the exception (``except Exception as e:``) and
emits a stderr warning via ``print(..., file=sys.stderr)``, matching the
observability pattern used throughout the ``audit_file`` function in the same
module. Control flow is unchanged — it still returns the fallback evidence
string ``"except clause with silent swallow"`` (graceful degradation preserved).

These are code-inspection tests (NOT runtime tests) following the pattern in
``tests/test_ownership_silent_swallow.py`` and the ``TestOsExitRegression``
class in ``tests/test_sigint_handling.py``: read the source, slice the relevant
scope, and assert the observability call is present. The except block lives in
a fallback path (file read / decode errors) that is hard to trigger reliably
and portably, so static inspection is the appropriate guard.
