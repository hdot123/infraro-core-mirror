"""Tests for D1 reverse drift watch - VAL-DRF-002, VAL-DRF-003.

Tests the classification of orphan issues (open issues not in current findings):
1. Has merge evidence → grace then close
2. Has session evidence → grace then close
3. No evidence → retain with blocking reason recorded

All tests follow TDD: written before implementation, must fail initially.
