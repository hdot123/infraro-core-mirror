"""Workflow permissions contract tests (F4 — VAL-M2-104/105/107, INFRA-688).

Three guard assertions:
1. Every workflow must have a top-level permissions baseline (INFRA-688) —
   new jobs added without declarations must fall back to read-only, never
   to GitHub's implicit repo defaults.
2. Every job must have explicit permissions (top-level baseline satisfies
   runtime behavior; job-level declarations are overrides) — never relying
   on GitHub's implicit defaults.
3. ci.yml and qa.yml triggers must never have paths/paths-ignore filters —
   ci-ok/qa-ok are required checks; paths filters would make them permanently
   pending, blocking the entire repo.
