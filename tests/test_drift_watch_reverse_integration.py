"""Integration tests for D1 reverse drift watch execution layer.

Tests that classify_orphan_issues + execute_orphan_classifications work together
to actually close issues (CLOSE_READY) and record blocking reasons (BLOCKED_NO_EVIDENCE).

These tests verify the action-taking requirement of VAL-DRF-003.

INFRA-403: execute_orphan_classifications now checks each issue's live state
before acting (skip already-closed issues, fail-closed on unknown state), so
the subprocess mocks must serve `gh issue view --json state` responses first.
