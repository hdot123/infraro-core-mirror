"""Tests for deadlock exit, GATE A session-completed override, and retrigger guard.

Coverage:
- VAL-DLK-001/002/003/004/005: Deadlock exit (reconcile)
- VAL-DRF-005: Retrigger guard (E4 form)
- GATE A session-completed override (trigger-droid.sh §4.7)
- Trust chain extension (_verify_fix_merged_via_linear Path B)

TDD redEvidence: These tests verify NEW behaviors added by round-1 worker.
Without the implementation, these tests would FAIL because:
- Deadlock exit logic doesn't exist → sentinel/idempotent checks fail
- Retrigger guard doesn't exist → trigger calls happen when they shouldn't
- GATE A override doesn't exist → session-completed check fails
- Trust chain Path B doesn't exist → sentinel-based closure blocked

    """Regression tests for production schema mismatch and null handling.

    Root cause (2026-08-17 10:20Z discovery):
    1. teams(first:1) query returns the WRONG team's completed state UUID.
       When issueUpdate is called with this UUID on an INFRA-team issue,
       Linear returns {data: {issueUpdate: null}} with an error — state UUID
       doesn't belong to the issue's team.
    2. The chained .get('data', {}).get('issueUpdate', {}).get('success') then
       crashes because .get('issueUpdate', {}) returns None (key exists, value
       is None), and None.get('success') raises AttributeError.
    3. The except block catches it, DEADLOCK_RESULT='FAIL', every tick retries.

    Fix:
    - Use team(teamId: $TEAM_ID) instead of teams(first:1) to get the correct
      team's completed state UUID.
    - Add defensive null checks with fail-closed semantics so that if Linear
      still returns null, we log the error cleanly instead of crashing.
    - Wrap status file read in try/except for corrupt/empty files.

    Test fixtures use production-schema status files (version, issueRef,
    sessionId, exitCode, prUrl, heartbeat, etc.) from real INFRA-337/342/345.
