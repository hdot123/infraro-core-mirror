    INFRA-403 hardening (aligned with auto_close_resolved gates):

      they are dedup bookkeeping, not live orphans.
    - Categories whose audit tool failed this tick are classified BLOCKED

    - Self-audit category is classified BLOCKED (INFRA-216: transient health
      signals must not be auto-closed — flapping loop protection).
    - Issue fields prefer the pre-parsed rule_id/location keys and fall back to
      parsing the body, so compact get_open_issues() dicts work in production.

    BLOCKED classification above with audit trail):
    1. Self-audit category exemption: evolution_self_audit issues are transient health
       signals that resolve when scanner recovers, not when code is fixed. Auto-closing
       them triggers flapping loop with state gate.
    2. Failed categories skip: Issues whose category tool failed this tick are protected.
       A failed tool emits no findings, so its issues vanish from scan even though the
       underlying problem may still exist.
