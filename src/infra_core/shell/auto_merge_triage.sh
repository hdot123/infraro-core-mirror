# Auto-merge triage script (INFRA-416 / INFRA-428)
# Classifies PRs by mergeable state, mergeStateStatus and statusCheckRollup.
#
# Input:  JSON array of PRs via stdin (gh pr view/list --json
#         number,mergeable,mergeStateStatus,isDraft,statusCheckRollup)
# Output: JSON with 6 categories:
#           mergeable   (action: merge)
#           behind      (action: update-branch)
#           conflicting (action: notify)
#           pending     (action: wait)
#           stalled     (action: wait)
#           unknown     (action: skip)
# Exit:   always 0 (triage never fails workflow)
#
# Modes:
#   default            classify stdin, emit full JSON
#   --get-action N     classify stdin, emit the single action for PR number N
#                      (merge|update-branch|notify|wait|skip; exit 0; empty or
#                      invalid input also emits skip — triage must never fail
#                      the workflow)
#   --get-category N   classify stdin, emit the single category for PR number N
#                      (mergeable|behind|conflicting|pending|stalled|unknown;
#                      missing PR -> unknown). Workflow uses this to derive
#                      auxiliary outputs (e.g. stalled flag) without
#                      duplicating classification logic.
#
# Classification precedence (one PR falls into exactly one category,
# decided by classify_pr in a single pass — categories are exclusive by
# construction, no cross-select races):
#   mergeable=UNKNOWN    -> unknown     (skip; GitHub still computing)
#   mergeable=CONFLICTING-> conflicting (notify)
#   mergeStateStatus=BEHIND -> behind   (update-branch)
#   isDraft / DRAFT / BLOCKED -> pending (wait)
#   rollup empty or has incomplete checks -> pending (wait; early-fire guard)
#   rollup all reported, some not SUCCESS -> stalled (wait + escalate)
#   otherwise (MERGEABLE + green rollup)  -> mergeable (merge)
#
# Why these categories exist (INFRA-428):
# - BLOCKED/DRAFT previously fell into "mergeable" → every 10-min sweep fired
#   a merge attempt at an un-mergeable PR → red leg + the shared action's own
#   failure check run poisoned the head SHA (2026-08-18 self-poisoning
#   deadlock, PR #779 mechanism). wait = benign skip, schedule re-sweeps.
# - early-fire: pull_request_target(opened) / workflow_run of one workflow
#   can arrive before all required checks reported. mergeStateStatus alone is
#   async/cached and can be stale-CLEAN in that window; cross-checking
#   statusCheckRollup makes merge fire only when every check run reports
#   conclusion=SUCCESS. Rollup empty = no checks reported yet → fail-closed
#   wait (CI runs on every PR without paths filter, so an empty rollup is
#   always "checks not reported yet", never "no checks configured").
# - CONFLICTING wins over BEHIND: a conflicting PR must never be
#   update-branched into a blind merge.
