  # Decision logic — two-phase to prevent stale-check race condition.
  #
  # Race scenario (confirmed: run 32435306919/32435603998):
  #   When a PR transitions from draft to ready, a stale concluded check
  #   (e.g., 'skipped' from draft era) may coexist with a brand-new
  #   in_progress review on the same SHA. The old single-phase logic
  #   would immediately read the stale conclusion → ci-ok sees failure
  #   → cancel-on-ci-fail kills the running review → merge deadlock.
  #
  # Fix: Phase 1 checks for any active (non-completed) check runs first.
  # If found, return 'pending' to keep polling. Only when all runs are
  # completed does Phase 2 read the latest non-cancelled conclusion.
  #
  # Dependabot skip exception is unaffected: when no active runs exist,
  # Phase 2 reads the 'skipped' conclusion and the Dependabot check below
  # handles it as before.
  #
  # API-level resilience: a rate-limit/5xx body is valid JSON but has no
  # .check_runs, so jq exits non-zero ("Cannot iterate over null") — under
  # `set -e` that would kill the poller just like a curl failure. Same
  # transient-retry treatment.
